# Story and Narrative

---

## Setting

A cyberpunk world. You play as a ninja infiltrating a powerful corporation to recover a
MacGuffin — the nature of which is to be defined. The corporation controls media, military,
and scientific research. By the end of the game you will have saved the day and lost
everything publicly, or proven yourself to the world — depending on how you play.

## Opening Sequence

**End of Stage 1 — The Sewers**
The mission goes wrong. The commander hovers over your fading body and says:

> *"Give this one to the egg heads. I bet they can have fun with this one."*

Fade to black.

**Awakening — Stage 2 Opening**
You come to amidst fragmented flashbacks of training — serene, calm, distant. Slowly
surgical commotion bleeds in. Doctors and soldiers shouting about a control chip not holding.
Then silence.

You wake in an empty room. Unconscious bodies are scattered around you. You have no
memory of how they got there. You try to stand. You collapse.

You are within range of the facility's automated nano AI. It reads your chip input and
stabilises you. This is how you survive. This is also how the game begins to open up —
your physical proximity to nano computers gates what you can access, upgrade, and learn.
The chip's range does not expand. You must navigate the environment to reach new terminals.

**The Full Opening Beat**
The game begins at the maintenance tunnel entrance at the foundation of the arcology. The
gate is gated off but slightly open — not broken, left open deliberately by someone.

The player walks off screen. As the screen fades to black a hidden camera becomes apparent
— a brief red glow of its indicator light, visible for just a moment before the cut.

What this moment communicates: the gate was not forced. Someone chose to leave it open.
The camera means someone knows the player is here and allowed them through anyway. The
player is not purely infiltrating — they are being guided, or observed, or both. This question
should simmer unresolved for several stages.

## Narrative Threads

**The Chip**
The control chip implanted in your neck has more power than anyone anticipated — including
you. The unconscious bodies on waking suggest the chip failure was violent. The player and
the character share the same unanswered question: *did you do that? Are they dead?*

The chip raises a persistent thematic question about dependency and augmentation. The most
capable version of the player — the one who completes the hardest challenge — never needed
it at all.

**The Corporation**
The corporation you infiltrated in Stage 1 is the same one now holding you. The commander's
handoff wasn't a rescue — you were passed along as an interesting specimen. You are not a
prisoner of war. You are a research subject.

**The Lab Simulator**
The endless mode simulator isn't something the corporation gave you access to. You are an
escaped captive exploiting their own infrastructure against them. Every training session is
an act of defiance.

**Defeated by a Little Pup**
To be developed.

## The Mission

You are infiltrating the arcology to rescue someone. Who the target is and where they are
held is unknown. There are clues seeded throughout the world but the destination is not
established upfront — the player and the protagonist are searching together.

The target's eventual location in the building will communicate something about who they are
before any dialogue does. To be determined as the world design develops.

---

## Story Structure

### Early Levels — Negative Space
The first few levels after the opening are small active areas surrounded by significant
negative space. Large dark backgrounds, small playable platforms, the player feeling tiny
inside something enormous.

Purpose:
- Establish the scale of the arcology before the player understands it
- Tutorial the skills introduced in stage 1 with focused attention
- Use emptiness as atmosphere — the building is vast and indifferent

### Story to Inciting Incident
The player works through the negative space levels, picking up story context and developing
movement skills. The inciting incident — details to be developed — brings the player out of
the lower building and into the surgical labs near the middle of the arcology.

The vertical jump from the foundation to near the middle of the building is itself a narrative
beat. The scale of that distance communicated through the map.

### The Surgical Labs
The player explores the labs and discovers the nano system — both as a game mechanic and as
a story revelation. What the nano is, where it came from, and what it implies are seeded here.

### The Maintenance Hub
After the labs the player reaches the maintenance hub — the central node of the building's
infrastructure. Multiple connections to other districts are visible. All are locked except one.

The open connection leads to:
- Executive Offices
- Engineering

This is the Metroid moment — the player sees the shape of the world and understands that
what's locked now will be unlocked by something earned later.

### Clues to the Target's Location
Clues are seeded throughout the world via the environmental storytelling approach — notes,
emails, photographs, activated objects. The player pieces together where the target might be
held through discovery rather than exposition.

---

## Environmental Storytelling

Characters are revealed through discovered objects — notes, emails, photographs, activated
items — rather than cutscenes or dialogue dumps. The world has a life that exists
independently of the player's presence.

Activating or examining an object can trigger a brief thought from the player character.
Example: finding a photograph triggers "the family in this photo looks happy." Objects carry
emotional weight without exposition.

### The Young Scientist
Unsure about working for a large corporation. Quietly rebellious spirit. Created the hacked
simulator mode as a small personal act of defiance — something unauthorised buried inside
corporate infrastructure.

Revealed entirely through what they left behind — notes, emails, small objects in the lab
environment. Their arc is told without them ever appearing on screen.

---

## Endings

**Normal Ending**
You defeat the aging CEO and recover the MacGuffin. The media frames it as a ninja
assassinating a helpless old man. You saved the day. Nobody knows. You are shamed and
forced to live in exile.

A commentary on media, power, and narrative control — doing the right thing is not always
recognised. Victory without vindication.

**Hard Mode Ending**
Completing the gauntlet challenge triggers the activation of a massive mech on top of a
ruined building. Defeating it reveals you to the world as the true hero. The triumphant
ending must be earned, not found.

**Tier 4 — Hidden Ending**
To be developed. Triggered by saving all collectibles AND forfeiting all upgrade points
simultaneously. The game recognises total commitment. Something nobody will find by accident.

## World Design — The Arcology

### Concept
The arcology is not just a setting — it is the thesis statement of the game's themes
rendered as architecture. Wealth and power are physically elevated. The higher you are in the
building the more privileged your existence. Maintenance infrastructure threads through every
level like a circulatory system — invisible to residents but essential to the building's
survival. You start at the bottom and climb.

The world is one contiguous space. Areas bleed into each other rather than existing as
discrete layers. The player builds a mental model of the space over time through exploration
rather than receiving it upfront.

### Design Reference — Metroid
The arcology map takes direct design inspiration from the Metroid series. Specific principles:

**Forced exploration** — the path forward is sometimes adjacent to where the player has
already been but requires a new ability or access tier to reach. Future areas are visible or
adjacent before they are accessible, building anticipation.

**Environmental storytelling through architecture** — district transitions are readable
without signage. Worker housing looks different from executive offices.

**The map as a puzzle** — the maintenance hub with multiple locked connections and one open
one is a deliberate Metroid moment. The player sees the shape of what's coming before they
can reach it. Each unlocked connection is a payoff for something earned.

**Backtracking with purpose** — new access tiers make previous areas worth revisiting.
Something seen but unreachable early becomes accessible later. The world has memory.

### Vertical Stack — District Overview

```
APEX
│  Executive Penthouse
│  Corporate Boardrooms
│  Private Residences — upper tier
├─ Engineering Core ←──────────────── accessible from maintenance hub
│  Research and Development
│  Surgical Labs
│  Medical Facilities
├─ MAINTENANCE HUB ← central node, connections to all districts
│  Commercial District
│  Mid-tier Residences
│  Public Spaces
│  Security Headquarters
├─ Lower Residential
│  Service District
│  Worker Housing
│  Storage and Logistics
│  Sewers ← stage 1
│  Maintenance Tunnels ← the unlocked gate, where the game begins
FOUNDATION
```

Districts hug one another — boundaries are architectural transitions, not hard cuts. The
maintenance network is not a discrete layer. It is a thread running vertically through the
entire stack, behind the walls of every district. Whoever controls maintenance access
controls movement through the entire building.

### Security Access Tiers
Maintenance infrastructure requires tiered security access to navigate. Each tier unlocks
connections to new districts through the maintenance network.

**Tier 1** — lower building access, sewers and service tunnels
**Tier 2** — mid building access, residential and commercial districts
**Tier 3** — upper building access

**Upon unlocking the third tier something unexpected happens.** Details to be determined.
It should recontextualise something the player has already experienced rather than simply
adding something new.

## Endless Mode — Narrative Framing

### Corporate Simulator and Hacked Mode
The default simulator is corporate and sterile. Environments are clean, options are
predictable, enemy configurations are standardised. It feels like a training tool designed
by committee.

A rebellious young scientist working at the corporation secretly embedded a hacked mode into
the simulator — chaotic, unpredictable, and nothing like anything the corporation intended.

Two unlock options under consideration:
- Finding a hidden access code somewhere in the game environment through exploration
- Completing the sterile corporate simulator unlocks it as a reward

Once unlocked, hacked mode enables full procedural chaos — random modifiers, unexpected
enemy combinations, environments the corporation would never have approved.
