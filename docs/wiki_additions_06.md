# Wiki Additions — Session February 23 2026 (Part 5)

## Revenue and IP Strategy — Passive Income Offshoots

Everything listed here offshots naturally from work already being done
on the main game. None of these require building something entirely new
from scratch.

### Directly from the Game

**Promotional idle game** — already planned. Free to play web game driving
awareness with optional cosmetic purchases. No pay to win. Small but
consistent revenue stream with zero additional development cost beyond
what is already planned.

**Hard mode DLC or gauntlet expansion** — the gauntlet structure is already
designed. Additional challenge tiers, new clone variants, new boss phases
packaged as paid content for players who complete the base game and want
more. Natural extension with most systems already in place.

**Soundtrack release** — a cyberpunk ninja aesthetic demands a strong score.
If the music is good, releasing it on Bandcamp and Spotify generates passive
royalty income and builds community around the game independently of the
game itself.

### From the Development Process

**Godot course or tutorial series** — the entire learning journey from zero
is being documented carefully. A structured course taught from the learner's
perspective rather than an expert's has genuine market value. Platforms:
Udemy, Gumroad, or a personal site. Design led education specifically —
combining Godot technical skills with thoughtful game design — represents
a gap in the current market.

**Game design document as a product** — the wiki being built is a high
quality game design reference. A cleaned up version covering the design
philosophy, combat system breakdown, and boss design principles could be
sold as a template or reference for other indie developers on Gumroad
or itch.io.

**Shader and visual preset packs** — significant time is being invested in
developing a distinctive visual language. The resulting shader presets,
normal map workflows, and CanvasLayer configurations can be packaged and
sold on itch.io or the Godot Asset Library. Other developers pay well for
polished visual tools that are ready to use and well documented.

### From the IP

**Print on demand merchandise** — the game has a strong visual identity and
a compelling character. Cyberpunk ninja with a chip implant translates
naturally to merchandise. Print on demand through Printful or Redbubble
means zero upfront cost and no inventory risk. Posters, apparel, stickers.

**Novelisation or short story collection** — the environmental storytelling
approach — the young scientist's notes, discovered photographs, activated
objects — means the world has depth beyond the game. A self published
ebook through Amazon KDP has essentially zero cost and builds lore for
players who want more of the world.

### From the Community

**Patreon or Ko-fi** — development documentation published publicly attracts
supporters willing to pay small monthly amounts to follow along. Devlogs
covering the Godot learning journey, visual experimentation, and design
decisions have an audience. Not a primary income source but consistent.

**Speedrun community longevity** — a game with strong speedrun support stays
in content creator rotation for years after release. Consistent discovery
and sales without additional marketing spend. Long tail attention that costs
nothing once the initial speedrun infrastructure is built.

### Pixel Art Shader Pipeline — Asset Pack
The pixel art shader pipeline being developed for this game is a
marketable product in its own right. Most shader marketplaces are
dominated by 3D shaders and stylized rendering for Unity and Unreal.
Pixel art specific shader work for Godot is a genuinely underserved niche.

The value proposition is not individual shaders but a coherent system —
pixelation, palette restriction, hand-painted texture support, dithering,
and framerate quantization working together as a unified toolkit. A
documented, opinionated pipeline with examples and presets for different
visual styles sells differently than a collection of disconnected shaders.

The game development itself is R&D for the product. By the time the game
ships the pipeline will be battle-tested in a real production context —
exactly the credibility that makes an asset pack worth buying. Platforms:
itch.io, Godot Asset Library, Gumroad.

### Highest Leverage Opportunity
Design led education — a course or content series built around the
combination of Godot technical skills and thoughtful game design rather
than pure technical tutorials. This represents a genuine gap in the market
and has the highest passive income ceiling of anything listed here.

## Technical Art Reference Resources

### Screenshot and Reference Databases
Resources for building a technical art reference collection. Intended
for studying perspective, scale, sprite structure, and visual language
— not for style or creative direction.

**MobyGames** (mobygames.com) — the most comprehensive screenshot
database available. Search any game, filter by platform, download high
quality screenshots. Free to browse.

**Giant Bomb** (giantbomb.com) — excellent screenshot library with
good platform and genre filtering.

**GameFAQs** (gamefaqs.gamespot.com) — user submitted screenshots
spanning early console generations through modern releases.

**The Spriters Resource** (spriters-resource.com) — the primary
resource for sprite sheet research. Contains extracted sprite sheets
from almost every game ever made, organised by platform and game.
Shows exactly how sprite sheets are structured across different eras
and how directional animation sets are organised. Bookmark immediately.

## Technical Art Reference — Games by Era

A reference list for studying oblique perspective, character to
environment scale, 2D action game visual language, and sprite
structure across console generations. Intended as a technical
study collection, not a style reference.

### NES
- **The Legend of Zelda** — foundational oblique perspective in action
  games, character to environment scale, readable tile based world
- **Contra** — character scale and readability in dense environments
- **Ikari Warriors** — early oblique perspective twin stick style layout,
  enemy and player scale relationships

### SNES
- **The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past** — the gold standard
  oblique perspective reference for this era. Study the angle, the
  tile structure, the character to environment scale, and how height
  is communicated through sprite layering
- **Secret of Mana** — oblique perspective with detailed environmental
  objects and strong foreground and background separation
- **Final Fight** — character scale and readability during dense combat

### PlayStation / N64 Era
- **Diablo** — oblique perspective at higher resolution, atmospheric
  lighting in 2D space, how darkness and light create depth
- **Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance** — character scale in a detailed
  oblique environment

### Modern Pixel Art
- **Hades** — study the perspective angle, character to environment
  scale, and how detailed sprite work reads during fast combat.
  Also a reference for how oblique perspective handles height
  and elevation changes between areas
- **Dead Cells** — character readability during fast movement and
  combat, how effects and particles read against detailed backgrounds
- **Enter the Gungeon** — oblique perspective in a tight environment,
  character and enemy scale, how bullet patterns read visually
- **Hotline Miami** — extreme camera distance, very small character
  scale, how readability is maintained at low sprite resolution

### Modern Non-Pixel
- **Reference screenshot game** (stored in mood board) — the primary
  technical reference for perspective angle, character to environment
  scale, and three dimensional object rendering in oblique view.
  Return to this image when perspective questions arise.

### Notes on Study Method
When studying these references look specifically at:
- The implied camera angle — how steep is the perspective?
- What faces of objects are visible — top only, or top and front?
- Character size relative to tiles and environment objects
- How height is communicated through sprite overlap and layering
- How foreground elements render over characters
- How lighting and shadow suggest depth in a flat image
