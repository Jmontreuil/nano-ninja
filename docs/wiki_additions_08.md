## World Design — The Arcology

### Concept
The arcology is not just a setting — it is the thesis statement of the
game's themes rendered as architecture. Wealth and power are physically
elevated. The higher you are in the building the more privileged your
existence. Maintenance infrastructure threads through every level like
a circulatory system — invisible to residents but essential to the
building's survival. You start at the bottom and climb.

The world is one contiguous space. Areas bleed into each other rather
than existing as discrete layers. The player builds a mental model of
the space over time through exploration rather than receiving it upfront.

### Design Reference — Metroid
The arcology map takes direct design inspiration from the Metroid series.
Specific principles carried through:

**Forced exploration** — the path forward is sometimes adjacent to where
the player has already been but requires a new ability or access tier to
reach. Future areas are visible or adjacent before they are accessible,
building anticipation.

**Environmental storytelling through architecture** — district transitions
are readable without signage. Worker housing looks different from executive
offices. The art direction carries narrative load.

**The map as a puzzle** — the maintenance hub with multiple locked
connections and one open one is a deliberate Metroid moment. The player
sees the shape of what's coming before they can reach it. Each unlocked
connection is a payoff for something earned.

**Backtracking with purpose** — new access tiers make previous areas worth
revisiting. Something seen but unreachable early becomes accessible later.
The world has memory.

### Vertical Stack — District Overview

```
APEX
│  Executive Penthouse
│  Corporate Boardrooms
│  Private Residences — upper tier
├─ Engineering Core ←──────────────── accessible from maintenance hub
│  Research and Development
│  Surgical Labs
│  Medical Facilities
├─ MAINTENANCE HUB ← central node, connections to all districts
│  Commercial District
│  Mid-tier Residences
│  Public Spaces
│  Security Headquarters
├─ Lower Residential
│  Service District
│  Worker Housing
│  Storage and Logistics
│  Sewers ← stage 1
│  Maintenance Tunnels ← the unlocked gate, where the game begins
FOUNDATION
```

Districts hug one another — boundaries are architectural transitions,
not hard cuts. The maintenance network is not a discrete layer. It is
a thread running vertically through the entire stack, behind the walls
of every district. Whoever controls maintenance access controls movement
through the entire building.

### Security Access Tiers
Maintenance infrastructure requires tiered security access to navigate.
Each tier unlocks connections to new districts through the maintenance
network.

**Tier 1** — lower building access, sewers and service tunnels
**Tier 2** — mid building access, residential and commercial districts
**Tier 3** — upper building access

**Upon unlocking the third tier something unexpected happens.**
Details to be determined. It should recontextualise something the player
has already experienced rather than simply adding something new. The
maintenance network is the delivery mechanism — the third tier may open
a connection that was never meant to exist, trigger a system response
that reveals the building has been tracking the player's route, or
expose something classified. To be developed.

## Narrative — Opening Sequence and Story Structure

### The Mission
You are infiltrating the arcology to rescue someone. Who the target is
and where they are held is unknown. There are clues seeded throughout
the world but the destination is not established upfront — the player
and the protagonist are searching together.

The target's eventual location in the building will communicate something
about who they are before any dialogue does. To be determined as the
world design develops.

### The Opening
The game begins at the maintenance tunnel entrance at the foundation of
the arcology. The gate is gated off but slightly open — not broken,
left open deliberately by someone.

The player walks off screen. As the screen fades to black a hidden camera
becomes apparent — a brief red glow of its indicator light, visible for
just a moment before the cut.

**What this moment communicates:**
The gate was not forced. Someone chose to leave it open. The camera means
someone knows the player is here and allowed them through anyway. The
player is not purely infiltrating — they are being guided, or observed,
or both. This question should simmer unresolved for several stages.

### Early Levels — Negative Space
The first few levels after the opening are small active areas surrounded
by significant negative space. Large dark backgrounds, small playable
platforms, the player feeling tiny inside something enormous.

Purpose:
- Establish the scale of the arcology before the player understands it
- Tutorial the skills introduced in stage 1 with focused attention
- Use emptiness as atmosphere — the building is vast and indifferent

### Story to Inciting Incident
The player works through the negative space levels, picking up story
context and developing movement skills. The inciting incident — details
to be developed — brings the player out of the lower building and into
the surgical labs near the middle of the arcology.

The vertical jump from the foundation to near the middle of the building
is itself a narrative beat. The scale of that distance communicated
through the map.

### The Surgical Labs
The player explores the labs and discovers the nano system — both as a
game mechanic and as a story revelation. What the nano is, where it came
from, and what it implies are seeded here.

### The Maintenance Hub
After the labs the player reaches the maintenance hub — the central node
of the building's infrastructure. Multiple connections to other districts
are visible. All are locked except one.

The open connection leads to:
- Executive Offices
- Engineering

This is the Metroid moment — the player sees the shape of the world and
understands that what's locked now will be unlocked by something earned
later.

### Clues to the Target's Location
Clues are seeded throughout the world via the environmental storytelling
approach — notes, emails, photographs, activated objects. The player
pieces together where the target might be held through discovery rather
than exposition. Specific clues to be developed as the level design
progresses.
